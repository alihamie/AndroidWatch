The framework has been modified from a previous version found online and built through
a series of online tutorials. The original, unaltered
copy of the framework developed here is from a book on game development called
Beginning Android Games Development (by Mario Zechner and Robert Green). However,
the framework has been approved upon computationally and functionally throughout the
course of me designing it through tutorials and use.
Many improvements such as Touch Handling, bitmap density and scaling, etc
have been improved upon. All game logic, watch interfacing, and other designs are not apart of
the framework and have been produced only by myself and Ali Hamie.
